Verify function needs three things 
1. data
2. signature
3. public key 

it decodes the signature using public key.  
this decoded data is then compared with the data provided  
and it checks if that matched
while signing the data needs to be of specific length. which depends on the algorithm used.
the same algorithm must be specified while verifying
