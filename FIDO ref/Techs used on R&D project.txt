Basically three things needed for the POC
1. java server 
2. Android app 
3. ios app 


RSA encryption/decryption is very imp in this POC


To give you a head start.. check RSA crypto in Java
we need RSA key generation,  
ecryption/decryption
& RSA sign and verification 
The API's will be REST api's
working on https


setting up https connection in java using tomcat via eclipse IDE

package org.ebayopensource.fidouaf.res
[2/12/2016 4:18 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
go to this resource file
[2/12/2016 4:18 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
it will have all the methods / resources offered by the server
[2/12/2016 4:19 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
so the Android / iOS client will call these APIs to make different requests
registration request, deregistration, autherization req etc
[2/12/2016 4:19 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
so if u trace the functions call, u will get the code flow
[2/12/2016 4:20 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
http://BHL05235:8080/fidouaf_test/hello/hi if u invoke this API, u will get some output
[2/12/2016 4:20 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
GET http://BHL05235:8080/fidouaf_test/hello/hi
[2/12/2016 4:20 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
u can use postman to test this
[2/12/2016 4:21 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
yes, thats right.
[2/12/2016 4:21 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
and if we dont find any android developer, u will be android dev as well :)
[2/12/2016 4:22 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
yes, postman is a google tool that u can use to test rest apis
or u can use poster (if i get it right) from mozilla firefox
first thing is get the server running on ur system
i mean, the UAF server running
[2/12/2016 4:24 PM] Sudhakar Shenoy: 
import the ebay uaf code in ur eclipse and get that working



D:\FIDO Docs\UAF-master\UAF-master\fidouaf\src\main\java\org\ebayopensource\fidouaf\res ---- contains java server code

fido-uaf-core - UAF protocol implementation 
fidouaf - UAF server, a Jersey service application for demoing UAF protocol im 





[3/1/2016 11:14 AM] Amogh Tarcar: 
currently using @Path("/public/regRequest/{username}")
 
[3/1/2016 11:15 AM] Jasmira Fernandes: 
yes, so for demo we have to make this flow work ryt?
[3/1/2016 11:15 AM] Jasmira Fernandes: 
and sumthing more?
[3/1/2016 11:16 AM] Amogh Tarcar: 
this will be the starting point from app. 
[3/1/2016 11:17 AM] Amogh Tarcar: 
after that see what the server is doing with the request.
[3/1/2016 11:17 AM] Amogh Tarcar: 
after that android device will send a POST, with signed data
[3/1/2016 11:17 AM] Amogh Tarcar: 
this signed data should be first verified. 
[3/1/2016 11:18 AM] Amogh Tarcar: 
then android device generated public key contained in the signed data should be extracted and saved on the server side
